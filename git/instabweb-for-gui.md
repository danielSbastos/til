## Instaweb for GUI

> git-instaweb - Instantly browse your working repository in gitweb

Pretty awesome, we can browse commits, see the diffs, browse for the authors, branches and so on. By default, instaweb uses `httpd` as the web server, but you can specify any other, like Ruby's Webrick, and opens on port 1234 locally.

To start, enter a git repository and execute

`git instaweb`

and to stop `git instaweb --stop`
